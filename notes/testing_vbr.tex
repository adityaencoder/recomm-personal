\section{Formulation}
For each article $A_i$ in our database we know its 3 properties:
\begin{enumerate}

\item \textbf{$v^1_i$ is a vector of its graph-representation}:

Let $(V^1, E^1)$ be the coviewership graph. Here $V^1$ represents the set of graph-embeddings of all nodes (articles) $v^1$, and $E^1$ represents set of all edges connecting those nodes.  $d^1_{ij}$'s be the distance between $v^1_i$ and $v^1_j$. 
 
\item \textbf{$v^2_i$ is a vector of its sentence embedding}:

Let $(V^2, E^2)$ be the similarity graph. As above, $d^2_{ij}$'s be the distance between $v^2_i$ and $v^2_j$.

\item \textbf{$c_i$ is the value associated with that article}
\end{enumerate}
So, each article $A_i$ is represented by this triad $\{ v^1_i, v^2_i, c_i \}$. Although, this is a very general formulation. For the sake of simplicity, for now we will just assume that each  article is characterized by its sentence embedding and its value.

In this work, we will use Healthline content recommendation as a setting usecase to demonstrate our idea.

\redak{\sdhd{Problem Statement:}}\\
Now, the problem statement is: \\
Given that a user is reading an article $A_i$, what article must be recommended next so that we
\begin{enumerate}
\item maximize the content relevance to the user
\item maximize the ad-monetary value.
\end{enumerate} 

Mathematically, given $A_i$, we seek $A_j$ such that:
\begin{align*}
 j&= \argmax_J   \phi(A_i, A_{J}) ,
\end{align*}
where $\phi$ is the utility function. This above formulation is mainly for our \textit{Read Next} pages, but it could be easily extended to \textit{Infinite scroll}.
